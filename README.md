# Copy Active Files Tree

This extension provides two commands to copy information about open files in VSCode:

- **Copy tree of Active Files**: Copies a textual tree structure of the directories and files currently open.
- **Copy tree of Active Files Including Contents**: Copies an XML representation including file paths and contents.

## Usage
1. Open files in VSCode (from any projects or locations).
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
3. Run one of the commands.
4. Paste the clipboard contents wherever needed.

Note: Untitled files are ignored. Works with absolute paths and merges structures intelligently.
